<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, supervised by <a href="https://imcc.ustc.edu.cn/_upload/tpl/0d/13/3347/template3347/xiehongtao.html">Prof. Hongtao Xie</a>. 
Before that, I graduated from the School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University with a bachelor’s degree. 

My research interest includes multimodal digital human synthesis, motion generation, and face-swapping.
